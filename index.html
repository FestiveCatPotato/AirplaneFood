    <h1> Airplane Food? What's up with it? </h1>
    <h2> The Quantity </h2>
    <p> The amount your given is horrendously low, ranging from a small bag of trail mix to a small cookie the size of an average eye, which is too small to be considered food! We're paying too much to be given a cookie for a 5-10 hour flight! The only thing that saves their skin is the fact that they also provide the normal amount of a drink, something that if they didn't provide I'd never reccomend flying. </p>
    <h2> The Quality </h2>
    <p> Everything they serve is bland other than the drinks! The cookies taste like nothing, the trail mix is all nuts and a singular m&amp;m if you're lucky! You expect me to last my 5-10 hour flight on a bland cookie OR, and I can't stress this enough, OR a bag of nuts? YOU're nuts! Only saving grace is again the drink, as it tastes like the actual drink, something that honestly suprises me. </p>
    <h2> The Service </h2>
    <p> I'm gonna expand on the whole OR thing from the last paragraph, as I think it needs some explaining. Usually during flights the snack crew only comes either once or twice per flight, however most of the time one is for drink and the other is for a snack, meaning you cant get another snack or another drink, making it impossible to get the other snack if you choose wrong. Although I could be wrong about this, as I don't go on many flights, although the ones I have been on have been like this. </p>
    <h2> The Conclusion </h2>
    <p> Airplane food, excluding the drinks, is terrible. The quantity is usually pitiful, the quality is garbage, and you cant even get another one once you choose. Because of this I believe that airports should up their food game. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. </p>
